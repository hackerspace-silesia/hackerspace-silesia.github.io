**Hackerspace** is a community of creative people with different areas of interest connected with technology. We meet together in one place to create, socialise and take part in more or less crazy projects.

**Hackerspace Silesia** is made by people coming from the whole Silesian Voivodeship and beyond. If you want to see what we are doing and how we are functioning, then we invite you to visit us on our Thursday meetings at 6 PM.
